# Card Dealer Device
Welcome to the Card Dealer Device repository! This project aims to automate the process of dealing cards for card games using an Arduino-based system.

## Introduction
The Card Dealer Device project involves the development of an automated card dealing device.
The arduino based device uses stepper motors, an LCD display, and buttons for user interaction. 
The goal is to simplify the card dealing process in various card games and enhance the gaming experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
- Arduino Uno board or compatible board.
- Necessary components, including stepper motors, LCD1602 display, buttons, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the project's `.ino` file.

3. Connect your Arduino board and required components as per the wiring instructions provided in the project. (Remove cabel from PIN 0)

4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the device and interact with the menu using the provided buttons.
2. Adjust the number of players and cards to deal using the menu options.
3. Press the "Confirm" button to finalize your selections.
4. Observe the stepper motors simulate the card dealing process.
